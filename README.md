# Project Proposal

### Project title

Dinner Date

### What and why?

Have you ever wanted to try a new resturant, but couldn't find anyone to go with and didn't want to dine alone? Dinner Date is the solution! This social dining app sets up individuals in the same area looking to try new resturants. 

### For whom?

This app is targeted towards adults who are looking too meet others while trying new resturants and cuisines. I envision the audience will likely consist of mostly those in larger cities.

### How?

- Users can create a profile that consists of their information (name, age, photos, etc.) and indicates their desired date and time, cuisine and/or resturant, and price range. 
- Other users in a similar geographic area with similar food preferences will be recommended to them. 
- Users can swipe and match (dating app style) to find people to dine with. 
- Chat features will allow matches to meet and coordinate dining plans. 

### Scope

The app will require a lot of user interface design, such as profiles, swiping, matching, chat features, etc. Additionally, devloping the functionalities of the app would require developing a matching algorithm, setting up chat boxes, knowledge on geolocations, etc. Between these projected front-end and back-end requirements of this project, I believe it will be a reasonable amount of work for 4-6 programmers to take on.
